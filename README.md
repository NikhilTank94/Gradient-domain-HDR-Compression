## Gradient-domain-HDR-Compression
Developed a gradient domain HDR compression technique to compress the dynamic range of a given HDR image. Displayed the final tone mapped LDR image.
This technique works by calculating the gradients of the HDR image, manipulating those gradients, and reconstructing an output low dynamic range image that corresponds to the manipulated gradients. Reconstruction involves solving the Poisson equation. We propose a Poisson solver that utilizes only local information around each pixel along with special boundary conditions, and requires a small and fixed amount of hardware for any image size, with no need to buffer the entire image. The hardware implementation is described in VHDL and synthesized for a field programmable gate array (FPGA) device. The maximum operating frequency achieved is fast enough to process high dynamic range videos with one megapixel per frame at a rate of about 100 frames per second.
